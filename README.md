# Home Sales Analysis

PySpark and SparkSQL was used to analyze home sales data. Important features of home sales were calculated, temporary views were created, data was partitioned, and temporary tables were cached.
The dataset used for this analysis is `home_sales_revised.csv` (contains information on price, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and view ratings).

## Objectives
- Calculate average prices for homes based on different numbers of bedrooms and bathrooms and etc.
- Create temporary tables for SQL queries.
- Cache and uncache temporary tables.
- Partition data and save it in parquet format.
